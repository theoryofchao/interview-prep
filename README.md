# Interview Preparation

This repository was originally created for when I started to prepare for several Big 4 companies when I first graduated from university.

My goal for this is to continue contributing material to this repo for my own personal benefit as I advance my knowledge and also pass along some material to several mentees who have sought me out for guidance.

Personally, I've never been great at whiteboarding interviews. My mind goes blank and I freeze up. I get that happens in interviews and it sucks. Previously, I also hated asking for help, because I thought it made me look stupid.

Trust me, it doesn't. People who ask learn, and people who learn then progress.

I wound up into the rabbit hole called Imposter Syndrome

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)

which took a lot of effort to dig myself out of.

Hopefully, with that in mind, this guide can help you prepare for your technical interviews.

Good luck!
